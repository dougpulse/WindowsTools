Copy to a folder in Windows.  I usually create a folder in under Public Documents.  
Tested on Windows 7 in a specific environment.  
Use at your own risk.

- Usage (alternate):  Drag one or more files or folders onto this to add them to the Send To list.

- Usage (preferred):  Select the files or folders you want the paths of, right-click | Send To | UNC Path, paste into text editor.
